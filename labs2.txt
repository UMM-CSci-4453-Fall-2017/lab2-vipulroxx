Thoughts:
- We are viewing it as a movie theatre point of sale system.
- Recording the sales, items sold.
- Ability to set time sensitive prices.
- View sales summary for arbitary time periods (filtering by employees, items, etc).
- Recording current employee operating the system.
- Managing the inventory.
- Managing temporary pricing.
- For user interaction the employee should only be presented with the items that are currently being offered.
